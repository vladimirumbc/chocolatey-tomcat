    <summary>Application Server. Windows 32 and 64 bit.</summary>
    <description>Tomcat is a Application Server. It is possible to run Web application ARchive (WAR) files using Tomcat. Apache Tomcat requires a JDK in order to run.

### Prerequisite
* JDK (Java Development Kit) is required. It can be any JDK compatible with Oracle JDK 8. It was not listed as dependency, in order to support different variations of JDK.
* Environment variable `JAVA_HOME` needs to be set to a JDK path. Many JDK installers already do this for users.

### Usage
After installation, configuration and application data are installed in a folder named `Tomcat9` (or the correct major version), which locates in `%ProgramData%` (or `%LocalAppData%` when admin right is not granted). The folder is supposed to be managed by user (site manager), and it will not be touched when this package gets upgraded or uninstalled.

If admin right is granted, a [service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_service) is installed with service name `Tomcat9` and display name beginning with “Apache Tomcat”. It is neither started nor enabled (start on boot) by default. Services can be managed with a [MMC (Microsoft Management Console)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Management_Console) snap-in, which can be accessed by running `services.msc`. In the snap-in the service can be started, stopped, and enabled on-boot. Please refer to third-party guides (such as [this one](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/open-windows-services)) for managing services on Windows.

### Migration guide
Previous versions (8.0 to 8.5.12, and 7.0 to 7.0.69) of this package were maintained by `skyguy94` (Ritch Melton), which support customizing installation location and service name. They are no longer supported. Please check your `options.xml` to find your old customization.</description>
